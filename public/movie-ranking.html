<h1> The Best Movies According to Death and her Trophy Husbands</h1>
<h2> And this is an absurdly biased take </h2>
<hr />

<h3>Midsommer</h3>
<p> An indulgent horror classic that has just the right amount of gore and existential dread
    to keep you up at night. One of Aki's all time favorites. I can't tell if that fact doubles
    as commentary on his current predicament.

<h3>Dungeons and Dragons: Honor Amongst Thieves</h3>
<p> One of Draco's Favorites: No elaboration</p>

<h3>The Nightmare Before Christmas</h3>
<p>An undisputed classic. If you disagree with Mia on this you will actually meet a fate worse than 
    Death itself. No pun intended.
